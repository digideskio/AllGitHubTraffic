AllGitHubTraffic

Chrome extension that plots traffic data from all your public GitHub repositories on one chart.

## How to use it
- install it from Chrome Web Store or via `Load unpacked extension` feature
- go to github.com
- log in
- click extension icon in the address bar

## Why extension?
Since traffic data are not available via GitHub API (yet), I had to create a Chrome extension in order to pull the traffic data (otherwise these are blocked by CORS). This is a hack.
