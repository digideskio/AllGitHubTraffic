AllGithubTraffic
================

Plot data from all GitHub repositories on one chart.

*This is a quick proof of concept, not a finished product.*
Since traffic data are not available via GitHub API, I had to create a Chrome extension in order to pull the traffic data (otherwise these are blocked by CORS). This is a hack.
